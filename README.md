# Crafty Bay

Hi, I'm Md Mahmud Hossain Ferdous, and I want to share with you my latest project, an e-commerce app called 'Crafty Bay'. I used the Flutter framework to build it.

# Goals:
In today's fast-paced world, we don't always have time to go to physical stores to buy what we need. That's why I created this app, which allows users to browse available products, add items to their cart, and complete the purchase process all in one place. I also integrated a payment gateway, so that users can have a similar experience to other e-commerce apps on the market, even though it's not fully functional yet.

#Tools:
Framework: Flutter  
State Management: GetX
Backend: API
Architecture: tried to follow MVVM architecture
